different use cases

- different startign points (Mostly OK)
- different inflation expectations from fed, economy, when unequal (Mostly OK)
- different time periods (vs training) - longer iterations (OK)
- negative interest rate cases

future implementations

- penalize against swings in nominal rate (currently the weight is not right)
- additional action space : setting expectations for future periods



- max, min, mean, std for each iteration, graph, avg graph
-
